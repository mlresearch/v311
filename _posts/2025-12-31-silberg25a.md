abstract: 'Protein Language Models (PLMs) create high-dimensional embeddings that
  can be transformed into interpretable sparse features using Sparse Autoencoders
  (SAEs), where each feature activates on specific protein elements or patterns. However,
  scalably identifying which features are cohesive and reliable enough for protein
  annotation remains challenging. We address this by developing a validation pipeline
  combining three complementary methods: (1) expanded database matching across 20+
  annotation sources including hierarchical codes, (2) feature-guided local structural
  alignment to identify structurally consistent activation regions, and (3) LLM-based
  feature description generation. Our annotation pipeline demonstrates three key properties
  of SAE features that make them a useful source of functional annotation complementary
  to existing methods. First, they can represent more granular patterns than existing
  protein databases, enabling the identification of sub-domains. Second, they can
  detect  missing annotations by finding proteins that display recognizable structural
  motifs but lack corresponding database labels. Here, we automatically identify at
  least 491 missing CATH topology annotations with our pipeline. Third, they can maintain
  structural consistency across unseen proteins. Of our 10,240 SAE features, we find
  615 that are consistently structurally similar in unannotated metagenomic proteins,
  allowing us to structurally match at least 8,077 metagenomic proteins to characterized
  proteins. This provides a rapid annotation pipeline with constant time search regardless
  of database size, that automatically includes structural and function information
  about the feature that triggered the match. '
