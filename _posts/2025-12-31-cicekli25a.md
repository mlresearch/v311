abstract: 'We introduce BIRDccNEST (pronounced "bird’s nest"), an efficient unsupervised
  framework for characterizing cells and defining trajectories in single cell RNA-sequencing
  data by inferring directed cell-cell relationship networks. These networks are then
  transformed into cluster flow networks describing directed relationships between
  cell-cell communities, naturally capturing an interpretable trajectory and characterizing
  subgroups of cells. We demonstrate that this approach finds interpretable and more
  coherent cell communities and trajectories on several data sets. Code is available
