abstract: Somatic hypermutations (SHMs) acquired during affinity maturation of memory
  B cell receptors (mBCRs) carry important immunological signals, but remain challenging
  for protein language models (PLMs) to capture effectively. We introduce SHIVER,
  a mutation-aware antibody language model that treats each amino acid substitution
  as a distinct token, allowing the model to directly encode the context-dependent
  impact of SHMs. Trained on paired heavy and light chain sequences from human mBCR
  repertoires, SHIVER incorporates a tailored vocabulary, a subsampling strategy for
  data augmentation, and a mutation-focused masking scheme to better model the dynamics
  of affinity maturation. We evaluate SHIVER on the task of predicting mBCR binding
  to influenza antigens and find that it outperforms both general and antibody-specific
  PLMs using a simple logistic head. Our results suggest that explicitly modeling
  SHMs improves biological relevance and generalization of learned representations.
