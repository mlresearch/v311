abstract: Missense mutations in the MYOC gene, particularly those affecting the olfactomedin
  (OLF) domain of the myocilin protein, can be causal for open-angle glaucoma, a leading
  cause of irreversible blindness. However, predicting the pathogenicity of these
  mutations remains challenging due to the complex effects of toxic gain-of-function
  variants and the scarcity of labeled clinical data. Herein, we present GOLF, a generative
  AI framework for assessing and explaining the pathogenicity of OLF domain variants.
  GOLF collects and curates a comprehensive dataset of OLF homologs and trains generative
  models that evaluate monoallelic missense mutations. While these models exhibit
  diverse predictive behaviors, they collectively achieve accurate classification
  of known pathogenic and benign variants. To interpret their decision mechanisms,
  GOLF uses a sparse autoencoder (SAE) that reveals the underlying biochemical features
  exploited by the generative models to categorize variant effects. GOLF enables accurate
  evaluation of disease-causing mutations, supporting early genetic risk stratification
  for glaucoma and facilitating interpretable investigations into the molecular basis
  of pathogenic variants.
