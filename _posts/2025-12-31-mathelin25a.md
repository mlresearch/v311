abstract: 'Personalizing combination therapies in oncology requires navigating an
  immense space of possible drug and dose combinations, a task that remains largely
  infeasible through exhaustive experimentation. Recent developments in patient-derived
  models have enabled high-throughput ex vivo screening, but the number of feasible
  experiments is limited. Further, a tight therapeutic window makes gathering molecular
  profiling information (e.g. RNA-seq) impractical as a means of guiding drug response
  prediction. This leads to a challenging cold-start problem: how do we select the
  most informative combinations to test early, when no prior information about the
  patient is available? We propose a strategy that leverages a pretrained deep learning
  model built on historical drug response data. The model provides both embeddings
  for drug combinations and dose-level importance scores, enabling a principled selection
  of initial experiments. We combine clustering of drug embeddings to ensure functional
  diversity with a dose-weighting mechanism that prioritizes doses based on their
  historical informativeness. Retrospective simulations on large-scale drug combination
  datasets show that our method substantially improves initial screening efficiency
  compared to baselines, offering a viable path for more effective early-phase decision-making
  in personalized combination drug screens.'
