abstract: Cancer is a genetic disorder whose clonal evolution can be monitored by
  tracking noisy genome-wide copy number variants. We introduce the Copy Number Stochastic
  Block Model (CN-SBM), a probabilistic framework that jointly clusters samples and
  genomic regions based on discrete copy number states using a bipartite categorical
  block model. Unlike models relying on Gaussian or Poisson assumptions, CN-SBM respects
  the discrete nature of CNV calls and captures subpopulation-specific patterns through
  block-wise structure. Using a two-stage approach, CN-SBM decomposes CNV data into
  primary and residual components, enabling detection of both large-scale chromosomal
  alterations and finer aberrations. We derive a scalable variational inference algorithm
  for application to large cohorts and high-resolution data. Benchmarks on simulated
  and real datasets show improved model fit over existing methods. Applied to TCGA
  low-grade glioma data, CN-SBM reveals clinically relevant subtypes and structured
  residual variation, aiding patient stratification in survival analysis. These results
  establish CN-SBM as an interpretable, scalable framework for CNV analysis with direct
  relevance for tumor heterogeneity and prognosis.
