abstract: Computational design of T cell receptors (TCRs) that bind to epitopes holds
  the potential to revolutionize targeted immunotherapy. However, computational design
  of TCRs for novel epitopes is challenging due to the scarcity of training data,
  and the absence of known cognate TCRs for novel epitopes. In this study, we aim
  to generate high-quality cognate TCRs particularly for novel epitopes with no known
  cognate TCRs, a problem that remains under-explored in the field. We propose to
  incorporate in-context learning, successfully used with large language models to
  perform new generative tasks, to the task of TCR generation for novel epitopes.
  By providing cognate TCRs as additional context, we enhance the model’s ability
  to generate high-quality TCRs for novel epitopes. We first unlock the power of in-context
  learning by training a model to generate new TCRs based on both a target epitope
  and a small set of its cognate TCRs, so-called in-context training (ICT). We then
  self-generate its own TCR contexts based on a target epitope, as novel epitopes
  lack known binding TCRs, and use it as an inference prompt, referred to as self-contemplation
  prompting (SCP). Our experiments first demonstrate that aligning training and inference
  distribution by ICT is critical for effectively leveraging context TCRs. Subsequently,
  we show that providing context TCRs significantly improves TCR generation for novel
  epitopes. Furthermore, we show TCR generation using SCP-synthesized context TCRs
  achieves performance comparable to, and sometimes surpassing, ground-truth context
  TCRs, especially when combined with refined prompt selection based on binding affinity
  and authenticity metrics. We assess the designed sequences’ binding probability
  and sequence authenticity using seven diverse computational models.
