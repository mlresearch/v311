abstract: Automated seizure detection in animal electroencephalography (EEG) is crucial
  for accelerating epilepsy research. While machine learning (ML) and deep learning
  (DL) techniques have shown promise in seizure detection for human EEG and some rodent
  models, their application to chemically diverse animal data remains limited. In
  particular, no prior work has explored deep learning approaches for EEG data where
  seizure/epilepsy was induced by exposure to Soman (GD), a potent agent known to
  generate complex and variable seizure dynamics. In this work, we evaluate deep recurrent
  neural networks—Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long Short-Term Memory networks
  (LSTM)—for seizure detection in EEG signals acquired by single channel (bipotential
  electrodes) from the rats exposed to either  kainate or GD, which later animals
  developed epilepsy (measured by spontaneously recurring seizures). We benchmark
  these models against classical baselines including Random Forest and XGBoost, using
  intracranial EEG data from eight animals. Our results show that GRU and LSTM substantially
  outperform other shallow models in both accuracy and robustness across EEG traces.
