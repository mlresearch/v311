abstract: 'Accurate prediction of T-cell receptor (TCR)-peptide binding specificity
  remains challenging due to vast immune receptor diversity and complex molecular
  recognition principles. We present a deep learning framework integrating evolutionary
  protein representations with physicochemical binding principles for TCR-epitope
  interaction prediction. Our approach employs separate ESM2 encoders for TCR CDR3beta
  and peptide sequences, capturing evolutionary patterns from millions of proteins.
  The architecture introduces two key innovations: physicochemically-informed cross-attention
  incorporating Atchley factor biases to model molecular complementarity, and hierarchical
  contrastive learning operating at residue and interaction levels to structure binding-specific
  representations. The bidirectional cross-attention mechanism models mutual recognition
  between binding partners, while Atchley factor integration provides physicochemical
  context—hydrophobicity, polarity, and structural propensities—governing biochemical
  interactions beyond sequence patterns. Hierarchical contrastive learning progressively
  refines representations from sequence patterns to interaction compatibility, creating
  peptide-specific clusters in TCR embedding space. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates
  superior performance across multiple scenarios. Systematic ablation studies confirm
  each component’s importance, particularly for novel peptide generalization. The
  learned representations show clear biological interpretability, with TCRs binding
  identical peptides clustering in embedding space.  This framework establishes foundations
  for computational immunology tools by integrating evolutionary information with
  molecular binding principles, which are informative for understanding TCR-peptide
  binding. '
