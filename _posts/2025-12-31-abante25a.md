abstract: Huntington’s disease (HD) exhibits substantial variability in age of onset
  (AO), only partially explained by the length of the CAG repeat in the HTT gene.
  While most studies seeking additional genetic modifiers (GeMs) have relied on linear
  models, we investigate the potential of non-linear machine learning (ML) approaches,
  such as tree-based models and graph neural networks (GNNs), to capture complex,
  context-dependent genetic interactions influencing AO. To address the challenges
  posed by high-dimensional genotyping data, we introduce a strategy based on gene-specific
  variational autoencoders for genotype compression. This framework reveals novel
  modifiers with effects dependent on CAG repeat length, underscoring the importance
  of accounting for feature interactions. Additionally, we integrate predicted gene
  expression levels from Borzoi— a genomic language model—into a multimodal prediction
  architecture. This integration allows us to identify regulatory variants likely
  to affect AO through expression changes. To our knowledge, this is the first application
  of a gLM in multimodal genotype-to-phenotype prediction, offering a new paradigm
  for interpretable modeling of complex traits in HD and related polyglutamine disorders.
