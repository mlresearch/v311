abstract: AI foundation models have transformed cancer histopathology by enabling
  rich, data-driven feature extraction from H&E-stained whole-slide images. However,
  their application to studying how germline variation shapes tumor morphology remains
  limited. Here, we perform the first genome-wide association study of breast cancer
  morphology, independently analyzing AI-derived features from histology images and
  diagnostic pathology reports. Analyzing H&E slides from 753 patients with matched
  germline data, we identified six genome-wide significant loci associated with either
  imaging or textual features, two of which replicated across modalities. We then
  linked these two loci to histological features described in pathology reports, visual
  histological features through generative modelling, gene expression modules and
  patient survival. We found that rs819976 in ATAD3B is associated with disorganized,
  necrotic tumor morphology, poor-prognosis expression programs, and clinical features
  including invasive lobular carcinoma and ER positivity. These findings demonstrate
  the power of AI-based histology to uncover and characterize germline variants that
  shape tumor morphology, and assess their clinical significance.
