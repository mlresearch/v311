abstract: While DNABERT leverages k-mer embeddings to model genomic sequences, its
  exclusive reliance on nucleotide k-mers can limit its effectiveness in capturing
  regulatory elements that lack distinct motif signals or display subtle, compositionally
  diffuse patterns. In this study, we explore a multimodal approach by augmenting
  DNABERT embeddings with DNA-intrinsic features—including nucleotide composition,
  purine-pyrimidine balance, CpG density, and structural properties such as minor
  groove width and electrostatic potential. These physicochemical and sequence-derived
  features offer complementary information about DNA shape and stability, often critical
  in regulatory regions such as non-TATA promoters and certain transcription factor
  binding sites (TFBS). By integrating these features with DNABERT representations,
  we show improved model performance in terms of overall prediction accuracy and ability
  to interpret pattern-depleted regulatory sequences. We applied this framework, DNABERT-CoreProm-MM
  (Core Promoter model with MultiModalities), to the task of promoter prediction,
  with a focus on both TATA and non-TATA Core promoter sequences. Our results demonstrate
  that the DNABERT-CoreProm-MM model improves prediction accuracy by 3.72% for TATA
  promoters and 22.56% for non-TATA promoters. These findings highlight the value
  of sequence-intrinsic and shape feature multimodalities in enhancing the interpretability
  and accuracy of transformer-based models, particularly for genomic sequences lacking
  strong motif structure. This approach offers a more comprehensive and biologically
  informed framework for modeling DNA regulatory elements.
