abstract: Deep learning models are widely used to extract feature representations
  from microscopy images. While these models are used for single-cell analyses, such
  as studying single-cell heterogeneity, they typically operate on image crops centered
  on individual cells with background information present, such as other cells, and
  it remains unclear to what extent the conclusion of single-cell analyses may be
  altered by this. In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation framework that directly
  tests the robustness of crop-based models to background information. We create synthetic
  single-cell crops where the center cell’s localization is fixed and the background
  is swapped, e.g., with backgrounds from other protein localizations. We measure
  how different backgrounds affect localization classification performance using model-extracted
  features. Applying this framework to three leading models for single-cell microscopy
  for analyzing yeast protein localization, we find that all lack robustness to background
  cells. Localization classification accuracy drops by up to 15.8% when background
  cells differ in localization from the center cell compared to when the localization
  is the same. We further show that this lack of robustness can affect downstream
  biological analyses, such as the task of estimating proportions of cells for proteins
  with single-cell heterogeneity in localization. Ultimately, our framework provides
  a concrete way to evaluate single-cell model robustness to background information
  and highlights the importance of learning background-invariant features for reliable
  single-cell analysis.
