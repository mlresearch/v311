abstract: 'Learning spatial context of cells through pretraining on spatial transcriptomics
  (ST) data may empower us to decipher tissue organization and cellular interactions.
  Yet, transformer-based generative models often focus on modeling individual cells,
  overlooking the intricate spatial relationships within them. To address this limitation,
  we develop GeST, a deep transformer model pretrained by a novel spatially informed
  generation task: Predicting cellular expression profile of a given location based
  on the information from its neighboring cells. GeST integrates a specialized spatial
  attention mechanism for efficient pretraining, a flexible serialization strategy
  for sequentializing ST data, and a cell tokenization method for quantizing gene
  expression profiles. We pretrained GeST on large-scale ST datasets across multiple
  ST technologies, achieving superior performance in generating previously unseen
  spatial cell profiles, extracting spatial niche embeddings in a zero-shot manner,
  and annotating spatial regions. Furthermore, GeST can simulate gene expression changes
  in response to perturbations of cells within spatial context, closely matching existing
  experimental results. GeST offers a powerful generative pre-training framework for
  learning spatial contexts.'
