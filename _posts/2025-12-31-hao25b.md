abstract: Understanding how genetic interventions alter cell phenotypes is crucial
  for uncovering gene regulatory mechanisms and identifying drug targets. Methods
  like Perturb-seq assess the impact of many genetic interventions on cellular profiles
  (e.g., RNA). However, exhaustively testing all perturbations, especially combinations,
  is infeasible. Iterative experimental design offers a solution. By using gene circuit
  modularity, sparsity, and prior knowledge, we can predict the effects of unseen
  perturbations and group genes into co-functional modules. Subsequent Perturb-seq
  rounds test these predictions, refining the model. This cycle prioritizes gene testing,
  maximizing knowledge from limited resources, and enabling general predictive models.
  Designing these experiments is complex, requiring a system to analyze data, integrate
  knowledge, use statistical tools, predict outcomes, and prioritize perturbations.
  We developed PerTurboAgent, an LLM-based agent for designing iterative Perturb-seq
  experiments. It excels at predicting candidate gene panels through self-directed
  data analysis and knowledge retrieval. We evaluated its ability to identify genes
  affecting gene expression upon perturbation using genome-scale data. PerTurboAgent
  surpasses existing agent-based and active learning strategies, providing an efficient,
  understandable method for designing sequential perturbation experiments.
