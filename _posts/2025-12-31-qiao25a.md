abstract: Identifying evolutionary correspondences between cell types across species
  is a fundamental challenge in comparative genomics and evolutionary biology. Existing
  approaches often rely on either reference-based matching, which imposes asymmetry
  by designating one species as the reference, or projection-based matching, which
  may increase computational complexity and obscure biological interpretability at
  the cell-type level. Here, we present OT-MESH, an unsupervised computational framework
  leveraging entropy-regularized optimal transport (OT) to systematically determine
  cross-species cell type homologies. Our method uniquely integrates the Minimize
  Entropy of Sinkhorn (MESH) technique to refine the OT plan, transforming diffuse
  transport matrices into sparse, interpretable correspondences. Through systematic
  evaluation on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that OT-MESH achieves near-optimal
  matching accuracy with computational efficiency, while maintaining remarkable robustness
  to noise. Compared to other OT-based methods like RefCM, OT-MESH provides speedup
  while achieving comparable accuracy. Applied to retinal bipolar cells (BCs) and
  retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from mouse and macaque, OT-MESH accurately recovers
  known evolutionary relationships and uncovers novel correspondences, one of which
  was independently validated experimentally. Thus, our framework offers a principled,
  scalable, and interpretable solution for evolutionary cell type mapping, facilitating
  deeper insights into cellular specialization and conservation across species.
