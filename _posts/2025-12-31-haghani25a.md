abstract: Accurate prediction of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) is crucial
  for understanding gene regulation. While experimental methods like ChIP-seq and
  DAP-seq are informative, they are labor-intensive and species-specific. Recent advancements
  in large-scale pretrained DNA foundation models have shown promise in overcoming
  these limitations. This study evaluates the performance of three such models—DNABERT-2,
  AgroNT, and HyenaDNA—in predicting TFBSs in plants. Using DAP-seq data from Arabidopsis
  thaliana and Sisymbrium irio, we benchmark their accuracy against specialized approaches,
  including a motif-based method and two deep learning models, DeepBind and BERT-TFBS.
  Our results demonstrate that foundation models, particularly HyenaDNA, offer superior
  predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, highlighting their potential for
  scalable, genome-wide TFBS prediction in plants.
