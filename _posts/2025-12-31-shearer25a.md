abstract: 'Disease-associated genetic variants occur extensively across the human
  genome, predominantly in noncoding regions like promoters. While crucial for understanding
  disease mechanisms, current methods struggle to predict effects of insertions and
  deletions (indels) that can disrupt gene expression. We present LOL-EVE (Language
  Of Life for Evolutionary Variant Effects), a conditional autoregressive transformer
  trained on 13.6 million mammalian promoter sequences. By leveraging evolutionary
  patterns and genetic context, LOL-EVE enables zero-shot prediction of indel effects
  in human promoters. We introduce three new benchmarks for promoter indel prediction:
  ultra rare variant prioritization, causal eQTL identification, and transcription
  factor binding site disruption analysis. LOL-EVE’s superior performance across these
  tasks suggests the potential of region-specific autoregressive genomic language
  models for identifying disease-causing non-coding variants.'
